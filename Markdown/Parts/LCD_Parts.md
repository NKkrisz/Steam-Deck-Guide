F7A Revision Pads  
![F7A Revision Pads](../../Images/Measurements/Kenfixed_LCD_F7A_Pads.png)

The one above the APU should be roughly 2mm thick, 7.5mm wide and 11mm in length.  
Any of these measurements might not be perfect, give or take an extra 0.5mm.

### Diode Readings

## Joystick
- Uses PS5 pinouts
- Thumbstick cap is capacitive (that's what the wire that's soldered to the module is for)
- There are two Types (A or B)

### Backside Of Right Joystick

## Additional information
- [Different input / controller daughterboard revisions might not be "drop-in" replacements (firmware flashing might be needed)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeckModded/comments/1gcftli/can_i_really_use_a_rev_f_instead_of_another_rev_g/)
