## Inputs

### Trackpads
- If they vibrate weird, make sure that the screws holding them aren't loose or over tightened

### Triggers
- If they rub against the backplate, make sure the shoulder buttons, triggers and the backplate are correctly installed
    - Backplate is "popped in" correctly on all sides
    - Smallest gaps possible between parts
    - No loose parts
    - Tighten screws
