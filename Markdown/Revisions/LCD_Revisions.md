# LCD Deck Revisions And Differences

## Cooling
- Different fans are being used (Huaying or Delta)

## Motherboard
- Some things were relocated slightly like the Wifi/Bluetooth module later on

## Cables
- Less cables seem to be used with newer revisions

## Inputs
- Input boards were changed
- Two joystick versions

## Audio
- Speakers were changed

## Storage
- On launch 256GB and 512GB models used PCIe 3.0 4x SSDs but later on 2x can be found as their replacement
    - This shouldn't affect gaming performance

## Battery
- Get battery type without opening Deck: ```upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT1```
- VDL (Early units) & Getac (Later revisions)
