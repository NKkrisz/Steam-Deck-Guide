# Input Modifications

## Joysticks
- LCD Steam Decks have 2 different versions (revision) because [capacitive touch was changed in some way(?)](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Left+Thumbstick+Replacement/148896)
    - To know which one you have go to Settings -> System and check the Steam Deck Controller ID
        - MEDA - Type A
        - MHDA - Type B
    - Make sure to buy the correct replacements if necessary (3rd party joysticks might have a switch on them to work as any type)
- Make sure to calibrate after modification (replacing the modules or adding silicone ring etc...) - [iFixit Steam Deck Joystick Calibration Guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Calibrate+Steam+Deck+Thumbsticks/150415)

### Hall Effect Joysticks
- Gulikit
    - [LCD version](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1026071.html)
        - This has 2 versions
            - The 1st version didn't have the cap included and required soldering on the old one from the stock stick
            - The 2nd version has the cap included, no soldering is required
    - [OLED version](https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1215825.html)
    - Both have issues with outer deadzone being square
- ElecGear (Only For LCD)
    - Might have issues with deadzones?

### Custom Made Hall Effect / TMR Joystick (More info needed)

### Joystick Cap Swap
- *Not Tested Yet - Basically OLED Joystick Caps Soldered To LCD Joystick Modules To Provide Better Grip And Look Better*
1. Buy OLED / LCD Hall Effect Sticks Depending On Witch One You Want (eg. Gulikit, sadly joystick caps only aren't available anywhere)
2. Desolder joystick caps from hall effect sticks
3. Desolder joystick caps from original sticks
4. Solder joystick caps from the hall effect stick to the original ones
5. Test if everything works correctly
