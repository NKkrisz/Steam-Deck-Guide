### Joystick Cap Swap
- *Not Tested Yet - Basically OLED Joystick Caps Soldered To LCD Joystick Modules To Provide Better Grip And Look Better*
1. Buy OLED / LCD Hall Effect Sticks Depending On Witch One You Want (eg. Gulikit, sadly joystick caps only aren't available anywhere)
2. Desolder joystick caps from hall effect sticks
3. Desolder joystick caps from original sticks
4. Solder joystick caps from the hall effect stick to the original ones
5. Test if everything works correctly
