## Micro SD Card Guide
- UHS Speed Class 3 - U3
- Application Performance Class 2 - A2
- Slower cards might struggle with bigger games
- Commonly recommended brands:
    - Samsung
    - SanDisk
- Example for a good SD Card
    - ![Samsung EVO Plus 256GB MicroSD Card](../../Images/Storage/Samsung_EVO_PLUS_MicroSD.png)
- With the above recommended specifications most games should work fine:
    - Some recent AAA games started requiring SSDs, read system requirements
    - Using the internal drive instead (NVMe, not 64GB EMMC) will most likely only reduce loading times by a few seconds in big games

## SSD Upgrade / Swap
- The SSD should be single sided, NVMe M.2 2230
- Lower power consumption is better
    - More battery life
    - Less heat
    - Less likely to cause issues with other components
- Upgrading from 64GB EMMC drive should be a noticeable speed bump in loading times
