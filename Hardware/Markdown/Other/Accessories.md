# Accessories

## Docks
- [Valve's Steam Deck Dock](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock)
    - Gets firmware updates from Valve
    - Comes with another Steam Deck charger
    - Most likely needs an adapter if used with a case on (USB extension or fitment fix)
    - Example adapter: [Project Killswitch - Steam Deck Dock Adapter From Dbrand](https://www.printables.com/model/411302-project-killswitch-steam-deck-dock-adapter)
- Any brand should work but it's recommended to at least have USB-C PD (Power Delivery) so the Deck remains charged
